# Shopping Room 3D Game

## Overview
A 3D shopping experience with AI shopkeepers built using React Three.js, featuring multiple themed shops (Western, Ethnic, Home Decor) with interactive AI characters.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite, Three.js/React Three Fiber for 3D rendering
- **Backend**: Express.js server with in-memory storage
- **Routing**: Migrating from React Router to Wouter (Replit standard)
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local state for game logic
- **UI**: Shadcn/UI components with Tailwind CSS

## Recent Changes
